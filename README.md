Exploratory Data Analysis on BRFSS health data



The BRFSS data contains information about health-related factors that are linked to diseases or injuries affecting the adult population in the United States (U.S.), including Washington D.C and three U.S. territories (i.e. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the US Virgin Islands). Thus, the relevant target population is all adults (i.e. 18 years or older) residing in the U.S., including adults in the aforementioned three territories and district.



I have come up with 3 research questions and have done exploratory data analysis.
